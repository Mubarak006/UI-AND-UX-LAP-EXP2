# UI-AND-UX-LAP-EXP2
## AIM
To design a basic mobile and web layout for an existing case study using Gestalt principles, UI design patterns, usability standards, and a brand logo.

## Procedure (Concise Steps):
Analyze the Case Study:
Identify the core goals, user personas, and functions needed for mobile and web platforms.

Apply Gestalt Principles:
Use Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Figure-Ground to organize layout elements meaningfully.

Design Layouts (Wireframe Style):

Use Canva, Figma, or Adobe XD to create basic responsive layouts for mobile and web.

Ensure clear hierarchy, spacing, and navigation.

Add UI Elements and Patterns:

Use common patterns: Hamburger menu (mobile), card layouts, tabs, form elements, modals, etc.

Include essential UI elements like buttons, search bars, input fields, and icons.

Define Interaction Behaviors & Usability:

Ensure tappable/clickable areas are large enough.

Provide feedback on actions (e.g., loading, success).

Maintain accessibility (readable fonts, contrast, alt text).

Use predictable interactions (e.g., swiping left to delete).

Create and Apply a Brand Logo:

Use Canva to create a minimal, professional logo that matches your case study’s brand colors and theme.

Export the logo in PNG and SVG formats.

Embed the logo into your layouts (top-left corner or splash screen).

Review & Test:

Check design for consistency.

Validate layouts for mobile and desktop responsiveness.

Get peer feedback.
